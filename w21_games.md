What is the purpose of the game?

- To control a paddle and move it around to break blocks without dropping a ball.

What element(s) are controlled by the player?

- The paddle, where you can move it left and right.

What element(s) are controlled by the computer?

- The brick and how much the paddle moves and the bouncing of the ball.

How does the player control their element.

- Using the left and right arrow keys.

How do the non-player controlled elements behave (movement, positions, randomness, etc)

- The balls movement is random when it bounces, by random I mean that you can sorta tell where its going and somewhat aim it.
  The bouncing strength and how many blocks it breaks is somewhat uncontrollable, breaking blocks is really skill sometimes and where you aim the ball.

If you were to program this, what classes would you write?

- I would write classes for the paddle, brick, and ball.

If you were to program this, would you use an array for some parts? What kind of array? What would you be storing in it?

- Yes, I would use maybe an integer array for the bricks. Store numbers for the bricks and use my array to more easliy plot out my bricks in the game.
